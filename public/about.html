      <h1 style="color:orange;text-align:center;">About "Relicious"</h1>
      <h2 style="background-color:orange;color:white;">What is Relicious?</h2>
      <h2 style="color:orange;"><b>Concept</b></h2>
      <h3>Have LOCAL dining with LOCAL people.
      </h3>
      <p>"Relicious" is a platform for foreign travelers to find the local people to have local food together, and for local people to find chances to communicate with foreign people through thier daily dinings.
      </p>
      <h2 style="color:orange;"><b>Vision</b></h2>
      <h3>We want to connect people around the world, and make our world better and smaller.
      </h3>
      <p>Food, is one of the biggest expectations for travelers, and one of daily lives for local people.<br>
      On the other hand, it's very difficult for foreign travelers to find nice local places to eat, especially which are popular among local people, also, it's very difficult for local people to get a chance to communicate with foreign people, even though they know that it gives them wider vision and chances to connect to other world.<br>
      <br>
      We built this platform to solve these problems and make the world better.<br>
      It will be very easy for foreign travelers to get local information, and for local people to get a chance to communicate with foreign people, if they are in the same place(website) sharing their aims each other.<br>
      <br>
      We hope more people can have a key to the world with Relicious.
      </p>
